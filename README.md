# Interviews Email Templates

This holds all the email templates we use to power [interviews.so](https://interviews.so).

This uses a tool called Maizzle to build these templates with Tailwind. It's a static site generator for email templates.

Maizzle documentation is available at https://maizzle.com

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the templates at [https://interviews.so/templates](https://interviews.so/templates).

## Development

Start a local development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.
